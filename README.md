ðŸ¤—What is YOLO?
You Only Look Once is an object detection algorithm in which only a single convolutional network predicts the bounding boxes and their corresponding class probabilities.

Read this blog and implemented the same on my system.

My implemention provided above.

âœ¨Implemented a small object detection model on coursera

Gone through this blog for video processing

Steps required to implement object-detection model:
1. Collecting the dataset
2. Pre-processing and Augmentation
3. Annotation
4. Training our model
5. Obtain the weights

Started implementing the above in roboflow
https://blog.roboflow.com/training-a-yolov3-object-detection-model-with-a-custom-dataset/

For Preprocessing and Augmentation: https://blog.roboflow.com/why-preprocess-augment/                                 
Augmentation basically creates new training images from the existing images. This task is done using roboflow itself.

Studied about overfitting and underfitting: https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/underfitting-and-overfitting

Read about batch and epoch which i came across while training in colab.
https://machinelearningmastery.com/difference-between-a-batch-and-an-epoch/

Images are annotated in roboflow and then trained using google colab .

This model doesn't works fine so first tried to implement on just two classes in colab.
